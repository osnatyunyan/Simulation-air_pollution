# Simulation-air_pollution
The program defines a metropolis based on an input file of a graph to be provided by the user, with the initial state of vehicles at city junctions, and clean roads (zero air pollution level).
Given the number of time transitions from the user, the program will simulate the behavior of vehicles in the metropolis, where at each time pulse the behavior of all vehicles (stay at the current node or beyond the neighboring node) will be determined randomly and the level of contamination roads will be updated accordingly.
 At the end of the program, the level of pollution on the roads and the location of the vehicles will be provided as output to the user.
